Welcome to "One More Rule," a platformer game created during the "Create with Code 2: Become a Junior Programmer - Game Jam" on itch.io. This project was developed within a 48-hour time period with the theme "One Rule." Collaborating with my friends, we crafted an exciting platformer where you play as an eyeball character, jump around, defeat enemies, and navigate through a castle, all while following a random "One Rule" challenge.

## Introduction
"One More Rule" is a platformer game created during the "Create with Code 2: Become a Junior Programmer - Game Jam." Developed in Unity, the game challenges players to follow a unique rule in each round, making each playthrough a new and unpredictable experience.
This was created quick and dirty during a 48-hour game jam that me and some friends ended up cramming into about 15 hours. We had a blast.

## Gameplay Overview
Play as the adventurous eyeball character and journey through the castle while facing various challenges. Each playthrough presents a different "One Rule" that you must follow. The rules can range from "Do not shoot" to "Your shots now insta-kill but set you on fire," adding excitement and variety to the gameplay.

## Features
- Platformer gameplay with jump, duck, left, right, and shoot mechanics.
- Random "One Rule" challenges that add a unique twist to each round.
- Moving platforms, jump pads, multiple enemy types, coins, and secrets to discover.
- Collaborative effort by a team, with coding and artwork contributions.
